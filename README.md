# fighttest
first person fighting game made in the godot game engine

## appendix N
- dark souls pvp
- super smash brothers melee

## the state of things
the game uses a dedicated server architecture because it's easy. the netcode is VERY insecure and that's never gonna change lol. i'm making this to play with my friends!
